## Overview

Build comprehensive debugging tools for homebrew development and reverse engineering. Includes CPU debugger, PPU viewer, APU viewer, memory editor, and trace logging.

## Goals

- [ ] CPU debugger (disassembly, breakpoints, stepping)
- [ ] PPU viewer (nametables, pattern tables, palettes, OAM)
- [ ] APU viewer (channel waveforms, volume meters)
- [ ] Memory viewer/editor (hex dump, search)
- [ ] Trace logger
- [ ] Code-data logger (CDL)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Breakpoints work reliably
- [ ] PPU viewer updates in real-time
- [ ] Trace logger captures execution
- [ ] Useful for homebrew debugging

## Dependencies

- Core emulation complete
- GUI framework extensible for debug panels
