## Overview

Comprehensive performance optimization to achieve 1000+ FPS (16x real-time) on modern CPUs. Includes profiling, SIMD optimizations, and architecture-specific tuning.

## Targets

- [ ] 1000+ FPS (16x real-time) on modern CPUs
- [ ] <100 MB memory footprint
- [ ] <5ms frame time
- [ ] <10ms audio latency

## Optimizations

- [ ] CPU: Jump table dispatch, inline hot paths
- [ ] PPU: SIMD pixel compositing, batch rendering
- [ ] APU: Fast sinc resampling, SSE/NEON mixing
- [ ] Mappers: Precomputed banking tables

## Profiling

- [ ] Criterion benchmarks for all components
- [ ] Flamegraph analysis
- [ ] Cache misses optimization

## Dependencies

- All features functionally complete
- Profiling infrastructure established
